# Assessment of applications in the backend

Clerks have the option of evaluating applications in the ‘OAP Proposals’ backend module.

The only prerequisite for this is that evaluation items are assigned to the call.
In order to be able to filter according to this evaluation, a threshold value must be defined in the call.
Filtering is then carried out by making a selection in the "Rating" select box:
- fixed available:
    - not rated yet
    - threshold (the set value is then shown in brackets)
- The ratings already assigned can then be selected individually.

The items are type-restricted:
-  Radio button (without option)
   The selection "Criteria fulfilled / not fulfilled" is automatically displayed here
   and if fulfilled, a 1 is added to the assessment value.
- Text area - free text for comments
